/**
 * The copy deck. CLAUDE.md: "New UI strings go in the copy deck, never
 * inline." Nothing in the repo had one before this file, so it starts with
 * what PR C1 introduces -- the org navigation -- and grows as Phase C moves
 * each surface's strings in.
 *
 * Descriptions are the mono second line §7.7 puts under each nav label. They
 * describe what the destination actually contains: no invented placeholders,
 * per CLAUDE.md's honest-copy rule.
 *
 * Deliberately still says "communities", not "Families". The rest of the UI
 * says community ("Share something with the community…", "All communities"),
 * and renaming the user-facing noun across 34 surfaces is a copy decision,
 * not a design migration one -- a half-renamed UI is worse than a consistent
 * old one. Descriptions here avoid the noun where they can.
